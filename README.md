This repository contains the code for the Tolgee figma plugin.

It provides ability to easily manage localization texts directly in context of your figma files.

To learn more visit [https://tolgee.io](https://tolgee.io)

## Features

- Sync changed translations from Figma to Tolgee üôå
- Just change the text of your Figma TextNodes and sync them with Tolgee üéâ
- Sync translations back from Tolgee to Figma üéà
- Open-source üî•

## Usage Guide

- Clone the repository and link it to your local Figma Desktop app
- Run the `Setup Tolgee` command and enter the URL of your Tolgee instance as well as well as an API key for the project with the `translations.edit` and `translations.view` scope.
- Name all nodes that should by synced by their tolgee key, prefixed by `t:``
- Run `Sync Tolgee to Figma` or `Sync Figma To Tolgee`
- Select all translations that should be synced
- Done üôå

## Current drawbacks

- Only works with one nesting level of JSON -> tolgee keys like `menu.button.title` will not work
- Because Figma defaults to Auto-Renaming Text Nodes, one has to edit the name of the TextNode manually instead of editing their value
